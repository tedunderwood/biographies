## measure_variation.py

# This script is designed to automate the process of condensing multiple models
# and testing them against pre-registered hypotheses.

# We start with a modelname (arg1). We expect to find 12 doctopics files 
# associated with that model. Each of those files will be
# condensed into a roletheme file and stored in a folder associated
# with the modelname. In doing this, we will also need to know
# the number of themes (as versus roles) associated with this model.

# Then we run smart-evaluate and regular-evaluation processes for all
# of the roletheme files.
