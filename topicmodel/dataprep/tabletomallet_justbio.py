# This script selects & prepares data for use by MALLET. It starts from the
# tabular data produced by jsontotable5.py, and slightly changes format.
# More importantly, it selects volumes distributed as evenly as possible across
# time, and ensures that the volumes for all our preregistered hypotheses
# will be present.
