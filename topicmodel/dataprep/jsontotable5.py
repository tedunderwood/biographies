# jsontotable5.py

# Written December, 2015. Rewritten June 2017.
# Ted Underwood.

# This translates the jsons produced by
# David Bamman's BookNLP pipeline into a simpler text file.

# As the telltale 5 implies, this is the last in a series
# of versions. This version is designed to work only with
# HathiTrust data. Earlier versions also used Chicago.

# It unpacks each json into a string of words
# separated by spaces, folding grammatical roles together except
# that passive verbs get prefixed by "was-" and dialogue
# gets prefixed by "said-". My observation is that in practice
# mod and poss are pretty legible from the part of speech.

# usage python jsontotable5.py -folder infolder outfile
# or
#       python jsontotable5.py -jsonl infile outfile
#
# the first expects separate volume jsons in a folder
# the second expects a JSON-lines file with one volume
# json per line
